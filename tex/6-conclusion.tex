\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we find that the objective function of most existing MGM methods, which is to maximize the sum of all pairwise similarities, could lead to an unreasonable solution in some circumstances. This is because the sum of all pairwise similarities only indicates the overall correctness of all pairwise matching results. However, in MGM, one mismatch between any pair of two graphs leads to a wrong matching result for all graphs. To overcome this problem, we propose an MGM method that forces on optimizing the worst pairwise matching result, i.e., maximizing the minimum pairwise similarity. As a result, not only every pairwise matching result is considered, but also the sum of all pairwise similarities is maximized as much as possible. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.
